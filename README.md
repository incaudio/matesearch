## Development

### Running Locally
The project is configured to run automatically via the "Server" workflow:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the Express server with Vite middleware on port 5000.

### Database Management
```bash
# Push schema changes to database
npm run db:push

# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run check
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Deployment Configuration
- **Type:** Autoscale (stateless web application)
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Run Command:** `npm run start`
- **Port:** 5000 (configured in server/index.ts)

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (auto-configured by Replit)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "development" or "production"
- API keys for external services (see Required API Keys section)

## User Preferences
- Prefer simple language and clear, concise explanations
- Iterative development with small, testable changes
- Ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies
- Do not modify `shared/schema.ts` without explicit approval

## Notes
- The Vite configuration properly sets `allowedHosts: true` for Replit's proxy environment
- Frontend binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` to work with Replit's preview system
- HMR is configured with WSS protocol and port 443 for secure hot reloading
- The server uses `reusePort: true` for better performance
- Vite config resolution was fixed to handle async config functions properly
