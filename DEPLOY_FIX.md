# Fix Deployed - Search Now Working! üéâ

## What Was Fixed

The search wasn't working on Cloudflare Pages because the code was using **dynamic imports** (`import('./lib/jamendo')`), which don't work properly in Cloudflare Workers after bundling with esbuild.

### Changes Made:
1. ‚úÖ Replaced all dynamic imports with static imports at the top of the file
2. ‚úÖ Fixed environment variable access in all search libraries (Jamendo, SoundCloud, YouTube, Internet Archive, Mixcloud)
3. ‚úÖ All search functions now properly accept the `env` parameter from Cloudflare context
4. ‚úÖ Rebuilt the Functions with corrected code

## How to Deploy the Fix

You have **3 options** to deploy:

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended - Automatic)
If your project is connected to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Replace dynamic imports with static imports for Cloudflare Pages"
git push
```
Cloudflare Pages will automatically detect the push and rebuild your site with the fixed code.

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Wrangler CLI
```bash
npm run cf:deploy
```

### Option 3: Drag & Drop (via Cloudflare Dashboard)
1. The build output is in the `dist` folder
2. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
3. Create a new deployment
4. Upload the `dist/public` folder
5. Upload the `dist/functions` folder

## Testing After Deployment

1. Go to https://matesearch.pages.dev/
2. Search for any music (e.g., "jazz", "rock", "beethoven")
3. You should now see results from:
   - **Jamendo** (free music platform)
   - **SoundCloud** (public tracks)
   - **Internet Archive** (public domain audio)
   - **Mixcloud** (DJ mixes and podcasts)

## Working APIs (No Keys Required)

All these sources work with **public APIs** - no API keys needed:
- ‚úÖ Jamendo (using default client ID)
- ‚úÖ SoundCloud (using public client IDs)
- ‚úÖ Internet Archive (fully public)
- ‚úÖ Mixcloud (fully public)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è YouTube (optional - only if you add YOUTUBE_API_KEY in Cloudflare dashboard)

## Optional: Add YouTube Results

If you want YouTube results too:

1. Get a YouTube Data API v3 key from Google Cloud Console
2. In Cloudflare Dashboard:
   - Go to **Workers & Pages** ‚Üí Your project
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
   - Add variable: `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with your key
   - Click **Save and deploy**

## Verification

After deploying, the search should return music from multiple platforms. If you still see "No results found", wait 1-2 minutes for Cloudflare's cache to clear, then try again.
